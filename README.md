## **Conversion** :desktop_computer: 
To convert your audio to text, add your audio to the "/upload/audio" folder, then in main.go modify these 2 variables with the data from your uploaded file:
```
const timeToWait = 10
const audioName = "record1.m4a"
```
Note: 
- timeToWait is the waiting time for the API to do the conversion, usually it is 30% of the total duration of the audio, so modify it according to the duration of your audio.
- audioName is the name of your audio, you should consider putting the format of your audio.
